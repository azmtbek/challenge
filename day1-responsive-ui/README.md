## difficulties faced

- built a carousel using useReducer, useEffect, and tailwind opacity class
- used window.innerWidth and useEffect for responsive design
- used svgs via jsx (I liked using it this way and applying class)
- learned how to make borders to texts via css 
  - used `-webkit-text-stroke` for that
